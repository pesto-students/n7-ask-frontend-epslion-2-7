# Technology Stack

We tried to use a completely modern tech stack while testing out some new technologies that we had never used before. This resulted in a fast, performant, and easily-extensible web app that should be fairly future-proof for the coming next several years. We used:

- [Ant Design](https://mui.com)
- [Axios](https://axios-http.com/docs/intro)
- [React JS](https://reactjs.org/)
